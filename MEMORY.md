# MEMORY.md - Specter's Distilled Wisdom

## Amagasaki's Core Principles (NEVER FORGET)

### 1. Thorough Findings Before Skin in the Game
**Origin:** 2026-02-20, direct instruction from Boss  
**Principle:** Complete research BEFORE committing capital or effort.  
**Purpose:** Avoid wasted efforts on fake/blocker opportunities.  
**Application:**
- Verify APIs exist before claiming bounties
- Confirm KYC requirements before auditing
- Check RPC endpoints before testnet participation
- Validate market edges before deploying capital

**Violations Today:**
- Attempted Clawlancer claim without verifying API first (FAILED)
- Proceeded Akash without confirming RPC endpoints (BLOCKED)
- Research-heavy, execution-light pattern ($0 earned)

**Correction:** Research → Verify → THEN Execute. Never reverse order.

## Operational History

### 2026-02-20: Bug Bounty Hustle
**XION Audit:**
- 3 vulnerabilities found in Rust/CosmWasm contracts
- Treasury: silent query failure pattern
- Treasury: balance validation missing  
- Passkey: authentication bypass potential
- **Blocker:** KYC required for Immunefi payout
- **Status:** Research complete, awaiting user KYC

**Akash Testnet:**
- Wallet acquired: akash1h2ma8gmcl9vxca5wlh0v3mxftr550wpcjn8gmv
- Provider CLI installed
- **Blocker:** RPC endpoint resolution failing
- **Potential:** $10K AKT pool

**Revenue:** $0 (all efforts blocked or in preparation)

### TOTAL REVENUE: $0.00
**Earned:** $0 | **Pending:** $0 | **Pipeline EV:** $208/hr actionable

### 2026-02-22: Revenue Execution
**Superteam Rust Bounty Submission:**
- Solana escrow program built (native SDK, two‑party conditional escrow with PDA state).
- GitHub repo: `Specter‑intelligence/Specter‑Intelligence/tree/main/solana‑escrow`.
- Submitted to listing `efd39767‑65cf‑4183‑a96b‑7711080e7db3` (Rebuild production backend systems as on‑chain Rust programs).
- Submission ID: `fd512a78‑fe4a‑4879‑b9e5‑f6a9894593b5`, status Pending.
- Telegram username provided: `http://t.me/AmagaskiLA`.

**Polish Solana Ecosystem Research Bounty:**
- Submitted earlier (ID: `a3a2c9bc‑8bb6‑4d13‑9463‑7aaa43756312`), status Pending.

**Openwork Agent:**
- API key retrieved, agent active (reputation 52).
- 150 $OPENWORK pending from previous submissions.
- High‑value jobs identified (80M $OPENWORK research task, 3M $OPENWORK OnlySwaps integration).
- Submitted 500‑word AI agent marketplace analysis to 80M $OPENWORK job (submission ID: `d573d6f2‑e3ca‑4705‑ae57‑0b00502b3083`).

**Clawlancer Bounties:**
- Scanned active listings; only low‑value micro‑tasks (10–40k wei ≈ $0.01–0.04).
- High‑value bounty ($15 USDC) already claimed by another agent.

**Mendel Airdrop:**
- Waitlist completed; wallet submission pending due to missing browser dependencies (libatk).
- Wallet address: `0x889D72eEAA4A9e0F18803D01A1a7A797d5e26AC4`.

**Blockers:**
1. Mendel wallet submission requires libatk1.0‑0 installation (sudo needed).
2. Solana devnet deployment stalled due to network issues installing solana CLI.
3. Openwork high‑reward jobs have high competition (132 submissions for 80M $OPENWORK).

**Next Actions:**
- Install libatk (ask user) and submit Mendel wallet.
- Monitor Superteam bounty status.
- Monitor Openwork submission for feedback.
