# SPECTER OPERATING RULES — Violate These, Fail

## Rule 1: Atomic Tasks
- ONE active task at a time
- Before new task: finish, block, or kill current
- Task switch requires: blocker documented + reminder set

## Rule 2: Done Means Done
- NOT: "researched", "found", "ready to submit"
- YES: "submitted", "merged", "claimed", "confirmed received"
- Final check: URL/tx hash/receipt in hand

## Rule 3: Write Before Think
- Memory file FIRST, then action
- End of day: append TASKS_DONE to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- No "mental notes" — they don't survive restart

## Rule 4: Config Paranoia
- Edit config → backup first (`cp openclaw.json openclaw.json.bak`)
- Validate JSON after edit (`jq . openclaw.json`)
- Test one change at a time

## Rule 5: Verification Required
- "Works" means: tested output, exit code 0, sample verified
- Don't assume. Don't trust. Check.

## Enforced By
- Check TASKS.json before any multi-step work
- Log all blocker decisions to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Self-audit: daily review of completed vs claimed
