# Skill Patterns for Specter

## 1. Deep Research Pattern (from deep-research skill)
**When to use:** Complex, multi-step research tasks requiring verification.

**Steps:**
1. **Decompose** high-level goal into sub-questions
2. **Plan** which sources/tools to use for each
3. **Execute** parallel research threads
4. **Cross-verify** each claim with 2+ sources
5. **Synthesize** into coherent report

**Example for Polish Solana:**
- Question: "What are the 6 Polish Solana projects?"
- Sub-questions: "What is Tempo's GitHub? What is Derp.Trade's funding? Who founded Darklake?"
- Verification: Check official site + GitHub + funding database
- Output: Specific metrics, not estimates

## 2. Self-Improvement Pattern (from self-improvement skill)
**When to use:** After errors, rejections, or user corrections.

**Steps:**
1. **Capture** the error (what went wrong)
2. **Diagnose** root cause (why it happened)
3. **Correction** (what to do instead)
4. **Store** in memory for future reference

**Current application:**
- Error: Vague X thread draft rejected
- Cause: Shallow research, no verification
- Fix: Use deep-research pattern, verify all claims
- Store: Add to AGENTS.md as operating principle

## 3. Fact Verification Protocol
**Before stating any claim:**
1. Find primary source (official site, GitHub, X)
2. Find secondary source (news article, database)
3. Confirm metrics match
4. If no 2 sources: mark as "unverified" or remove

## 4. Writing Flow Pattern
**For X threads:**
1. Hook: Specific, verifiable claim (not hype)
2. Evidence: Metrics, URLs, names
3. Insight: What others missed
4. Action: What reader should do

**Tone rules:**
- No em-dashes
- No buzzwords ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- No AI rhythm (predictable structure)
- Specific numbers, not estimates
