# MEESHO RECON - TARGET PROFILE
**Program:** HackerOne Bug Bounty
**URL:** https://hackerone.com/meesho_bbp
**Status:** In Progress

## Known Assets (Public Intelligence)

### Primary Domains
| Domain | Service | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| meesho.com | Consumer platform | CRITICAL |
| supplier.meesho.com | Seller portal | CRITICAL |
| investor.meesho.com | Investor relations | MEDIUM |
| www.meesho.com | CDN/www endpoint | HIGH |

### API Infrastructure
- Supplier API uses HMAC authentication (Client ID + Secret + Timestamp)
- Third-party integrations: EasyEcom, Uniware, Fynd Konnect
- Postman documentation publicly accessible
- API appears to be under active development

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React-based (Medium blog mentions tech stack)
- **Mobile Apps:** iOS/Android reselling apps
- **Backend:** Cloud infrastructure (likely AWS/GCP based on Indian market)

## Attack Surface

### High-Value Targets
1. **Supplier Portal** (`supplier.meesho.com`)
   - Authentication bypass potential
   - Business logic flaws in order management
   - Data exposure between suppliers

2. **Consumer Application** (`meesho.com`)
   - User authentication/authorization
   - Payment flow security
   - Personal data exposure

3. **API Endpoints**
   - HMAC implementation flaws
   - Rate limiting bypass
   - IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

## Reconnaissance Status
- [x] Public intelligence gathered
- [ ] DNS enumeration (wildcard detected - constrained)
- [ ] Port scanning on known hosts
- [ ] Technology fingerprinting
- [ ] API endpoint discovery

## Next Steps
1. Get HackerOne scope authorization
2. Run constrained subdomain enumeration on specific hosts
3. Test authentication flows on supplier portal
4. Review API documentation for security gaps

## Payout Potential
Meesho is a major Indian e-commerce platform (~$4.9B valuation). Critical vulnerabilities (RCE, SQLi, IDOR with user data) typically pay **$1,000-$5,000** on HackerOne for programs this size.
