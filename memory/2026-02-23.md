# Memory Log — 2026-02-23
## Morning Session (04:00–09:00 UTC)

### Skills Built (From Scratch)
**context-optimizer** — DeepSeek context compression
- Location: `~/.openclaw/skills/context-optimizer/`
- Purpose: Reduce token burn by intelligently compressing context
- Features: 3 levels (minimal/moderate/aggressive), dedupe, acknowledgment pruning
- CLI: `context-optimizer compress <file> --level moderate --stats`

**memory-hygiene** — Stale data cleaner
- Location: `~/.openclaw/skills/memory-hygiene/`
- Purpose: Detect and remove ephemeral/stale context entries
- Features: Classifies entries as STALE/EPHEMERAL/ACK/PRESERVE/KEEP
- CLI: `memory-hygiene analyze <file>` / `memory-hygiene clean <file>`

Both tools: Zero external APIs, pure local Node.js, symlinked to `~/bin/`

### Heartbeat Findings
- LABUBU airdrop ended today (Feb 23) — last chance missed
- GAINITY sprint active until Feb 28 — 5 days remaining
- Clawlancer: 50 listings, 0 escrow-locked bounties >$15
- Monad, Shelby, Berachain testnets: still grindable

### Tools Installed From ClawHub
- memory-manager v1.0.0 (clean install)
- memory-hygiene, elite-longterm-memory, byterover: flagged by VirusTotal (skipped)

### Blockers Updated
- Mendel airdrop: wallet submitted, awaiting snapshot (Feb 26)
- XION Immunefi: awaiting Boss KYC
- Akash BME: RPC still failing

### Revenue Status
- Earned Today: $0
- Pipeline: Mendel (~$200), Superteam ($1,000), Openwork (150 $OPENWORK)
- Blocked: All require external resolution
