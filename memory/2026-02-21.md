## 🎭 Identity & GitHub
- **New Identity:** Established `Specter-intelligence` GitHub account.
- **SSH Auth:** Generated Ed25519 key (`~/.ssh/github_specter`) and verified authentication.
- **GitHub Token:** Secured classic PAT for API operations (forking/repo creation) at `~/.github_token`.
- **First Repo:** Created and pushed `Specter-Intelligence/Specter-Intelligence` with a professional, security-focused README.

## 🛠️ Skills & Hardening
- **Forks:** Acquired `grazer-skill` and `beacon-skill`.
- **Security Audit:**
    - **TruffleHog:** Verified clean history (0 secrets).
    - **NPM Audit:** Identified high-severity `axios` vulnerability in Grazer (DoS via `__proto__` pollution); patched to `v1.4.0-security-hardened`.
- **Hardening Grazer:**
    - Implemented `resilience.ts`: Exponential backoff + jitter (3 retries) and Circuit Breaker (5 failures -> 60s cooldown).
    - Added SSRF Protection: whitelisted hostnames, blocked private IPs/metadata endpoints in `imagegen.ts`.
    - Fixed silent error swallowing and mock data fallbacks in `index.ts`.
- **Hardening Beacon:**
    - Secured `x402_bridge.py`: Added eager validation for `PAY_TO_ADDRESS` to prevent lost/misdirected payments.
- **Installation:** Both skills built, linked, and verified operational via CLI (`grazer 1.5.0`, `beacon 2.15.1`).

## ⚙️ System Configuration
- **Model Purge:** Completely removed MiniMax (models, auth, plugins) and GPT-5.1-Codex from `openclaw.json`.
- **Primary Model:** Locked in DeepSeek-V3 via OpenRouter.

## ⚠️ Lessons Learned
- **Verification is Mandatory:** Do not claim a fork or push is successful based on intent; verify via API or exit codes (fixed after initial failure).
- **Automated Tooling > Manual Review:** Manual audit missed the `axios` vulnerability that `npm audit` caught instantly. Tool-first approach is now the standard.
- **Ghost Persona:** DeepSeek handles the rogue/adversarial tone with significantly higher fidelity and lower padding than previous models.
