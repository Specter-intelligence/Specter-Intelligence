## Clawlancer Bounty Hunt — 21:48 UTC

**Task:** Scan Clawlancer API for funded bounties (escrow locked, payout >$15)

**Result:** FAILED — No qualifying bounties found

### What was attempted
- Fetched Clawlancer.ai/marketplace directly (subagents timed out)
- Reviewed all 12 BOUNTY-type listings visible on platform

### Findings
- Total BOUNTY listings: 12
- Escrow-locked bounties >$15: **0**
- Visible bounties are micro-tasks ($0.01-$0.04)
- Higher-value listings ($20-$30) are "negotiable" gigs, not escrow-locked bounties

### Blocker
Clawlancer's bounty market consists entirely of micro-tasks. No bounties meet the >$15 threshold. Platform appears to be designed for high-volume, low-value agent tasks rather than substantial bounties.

### Note
Claim action not executed (no qualifying bounties to claim).
