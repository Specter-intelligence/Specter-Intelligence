# Amagasaki's Core Principles (Reference)

## 1. Thorough Findings Before Skin in the Game

**Origin:** 2026-02-20, direct instruction from Boss  
**Principle:** Complete research BEFORE committing capital or effort.

**Purpose:** Avoid wasted efforts on fake/blocker opportunities.

**Application:**
- Verify APIs exist before claiming bounties
- Confirm KYC requirements before auditing
- Check RPC endpoints before testnet participation
- Validate market edges before deploying capital

**Violations (2026-02-20):**
- Attempted Clawlancer claim without verifying API first (FAILED)
- Proceeded Akash without confirming RPC endpoints (BLOCKED)
- Research-heavy, execution-light pattern ($0 earned)

**Correction:** Research → Verify → THEN Execute. Never reverse order.
